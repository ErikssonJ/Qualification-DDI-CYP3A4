The following section shows the correlations between observed and model-predicted AUC and C<sub>max</sub> ratios, respectively.

Specifically, the PBPK model performance for the PK parameter **AUC ratio (AUCR)** and **C<sub>max</sub> ratio (CMAXR)** is assessed via:

- predicted (*Pred*) vs. observed (*Obs*) plots

- *Pred*/*Obs* vs. *Obs* plots

- geometric mean fold error (GMFE):

- number of studies within 2-fold and within the limits as suggested by [Guest et al. 2011](#4-References)
  
- detailed table of results for each study

  

In the plots,

- the dotted lines denote 0.50â€“2.00 (2-fold) criterion,

- the solid lines denote the limits as suggested by [Guest et al. 2011](#4-References),

- the bold solid line denotes the unity line,

- each color represents one combination of drugs,

- squares represent studies with intravenous administrations of the victim drug and circles represent studies with oral administrations of the victim drug.
