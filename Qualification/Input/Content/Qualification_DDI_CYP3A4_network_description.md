To qualify the OSP suite for the prediction of the CYP3A4 DDI potential of new drugs, a set of verified PBPK models of index perpetrators, covering the range from strong CYP3A4 induction to strong inhibition, and respective CYP3A4 DDI victim drugs is specified to set up a CYP3A4-mediated DDI modeling network. 


The following perpetrator compounds were selected: 

- **Rifampicin** (strong CYP3A4 inducer)
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Rifampicin-Model/releases/tag/v1.0
- **Efavirenz** (moderate CYP3A4 inducer)
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Efavirenz-Model/releases/tag/v1.0
- **Fluvoxamine** (weak/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor)
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Fluvoxamine-Model/releases/tag/v1.0
- **Verapamil** (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor)
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Verapamil-Model/releases/tag/v1.0
- **Erythromycin** (moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor)
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Erythromycin-Model/releases/tag/v1.0
- **Clarithromycin** (strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor)
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Clarithromycin-Model/releases/tag/v1.0
- **Itraconazole** including metabolites (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor)
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Itraconazole-Model/releases/tag/v1.0


The following sensitive CYP3A4 substrates as victim drugs were selected:

- **Midazolam**
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Midazolam-Model/releases/tag/v1.0

- **Alprazolam**
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Alprazolam-Model/releases/tag/v1.0
- **Alfentanil**
  - Model file and evaluation report (*release* **v1.0**): TODO
  - Model snapshot and evaluation plan (*release* **v1.0**): https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Alfentanil-Model/releases/tag/v1.0



**Figure 1** shows the prespecified and developed DDI modeling network of interacting perpetrator and victim drugs for the OSP suite qualification of predicting CYP3A4-mediated DDI.

The published DDI studies between the respective perpetrators and victim drugs were simulated and compared to observed data. The following sections give an overview of the clinical studies being part of this qualification report. The respective data identifier (DataID) refers to the **ID** of the dataset in the [OSP PK database](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Database-for-observed-data).
